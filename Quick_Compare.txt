Quick compare is a custom compare method used in folder compare. As name suggests, it is faster than diffutils compare. However it also ignores a lot of things so the speed comes in price of accuracy.

Quick compare knows most diffutils compare options like whitespace ignore and EOL bytes ignore. But it does not know about linefilters.

Quick compare basically just finds different characters from the files. And Quick compare can be configured to stop compare after first found difference.
