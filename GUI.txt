WinMerge's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface GUI] is Microsoft's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Foundation_Class_Library MFC-framework] based. And programmed with C++.

As an editor we are using [[CrystalEditor]]. Threre are couple of other custom components, but mostly it is plain MFC code.

Some other parts of the GUI:
* [[Location Pane]]

= MultiMonitor support =
WinMerge supports using multiple monitors. WinMerge remembers its position in two-monitor setup, and opens in same monitor than last time. Most dialogs also remember their positioning. (''But not all??'')

Recent patch improved the multimonitor support by optionally keeping editor pane splitter always in monitor split.

= Splash Screen =
Splash screen is one bitmap, as described in [[Graphics]], list of developers and version number are added dynamically into it.

= Statusbars =
The main window has statusbar showing some general info in panes:
* item counts when folder compare is active, or
* difference count when file compare is active
* status of caps lock, num lock and sroll lock keys
