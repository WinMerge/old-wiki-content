[http://www.apache.org/ Apache] [http://ant.apache.org/ Ant] is a build tool for Java programs. It can be used for C/C++ building with additional tasks.

Prerequisites:
* Java version 1.4.2 or later

= Installing =
Installing Ant + C/C++ tasks requires some manual work. Follow the instructions below.

== Ant ==
Download Ant binary distribution from [http://ant.apache.org/ http://ant.apache.org/]. Unzip it to own folder (e.g. <code>C:/Tools/ant/</code>.

Create a batch file to setup Java + Ant environment:
 set ANT_HOME=C:\Tools\apache-ant-1.7.1
 set JAVA_HOME=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_06/
 set PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin

where <code>ANT_HOME</code> is your Ant installation folder and <code>JAVA_HOME</code> is Java installation folder.

To run Ant files, open Command Prompt and run this batch file first.

== Ant C/C++ task ==
Download "cc compilation task" source distribution from [http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/ http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/]. Note that it is separate distribution from ant-contrib files.

Unzip the sources to some proper folder (e.g. <code>C:/Code/Ant-cc-task/</code>).

To build cc-task:
* open Command Prompt
* run the Ant setup batch file (created above when installing Ant)
* CD to cc-task source folder
* type command: <code>ant</code> (That's right, just <code>ant</code>, it'll runs the (build) script from current folder)

Copy generated <code>cpptasks.jar</code> file from <code>/target/lib/</code> subfolder to Ant's <code>lib/</code> subfolder.
