Documentation how to compile installer and where to put files etc is availeble in SVN:
[http://winmerge.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/winmerge/trunk/Docs/Developers/readme-InnoSetup.html readme-InnoSetup.html].

=Installer Tasks=
The installer does a lot more than just copying files into WinMerge program folder:
* adds project file icon and associates it with <code>.winmerge</code> files
* sets notepad as project file editor
* adds WinMerge as ClearCase, TortoiseCVS or TortoiseSVN compare tool
* enables shell integration
* removes archive support files when uninstalling

== Libraries ==
WinMerge uses two external libraries:
* expat
* PCRE

We compile and distribute dll:s of these libraries with WinMerge. The installer copies library dll files to WinMerge folder

==Runtime Files==
Several runtime files, C-library, MFC-library etc are in folder <code>Installer\Runtimes\</code>. We use Visual Studio 2003.Net versions of those runtime files. They don't come with Windows versions (at least not in XP and earlier) and must be installed for WinMerge to work.

= Logging =
Installer can create a log from install process. This can help in solving installation problems.

To create a log, start installer from the command line, and give argument like:

 /LOG=C:\WinMerge_install.log

For example with WinMerge 2.8.0 installer:

 WinMerge-2.8.0-Setup.exe /LOG=C:\WinMerge_install.log

=Todo=
Some ideas to improve installer:
* prompt if user wants to remove WinMerge settings from registry when uninstalling
* download (and install) archive integration
* '''create MSI installer'''
* create installer capable running without administrator priviledges (possible? what limitations there would be?)
* allow to only uninstall part of WinMerge - e.g. uninstall just plugins?
